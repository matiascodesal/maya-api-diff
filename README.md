Check to see what's missing in Maya Python API 2.0

Maya Python API 2.0 released back in 2013.  One of the biggest complaints was that it wasn't complete.  There were classes from 1.0 that had been left behind in the initial release.  Autodesk has continued to work on the API, but is it done?  We're missing the OpenMayaFX module and there are still classes missing in each module, but the remaining classes that are missing are not ones that I have needed in the past.  Some of them may also be defunct at this point.
